# K8s cluster on Oracle Cloud Always Free Infrastructure (with Terraform)

#### This repo describes a way for provisioning free resources in the Oracle Cloud. Options are different for accounts in the Always Free tier and with a Pay-as-You-Go subscription. 

#### Scripts for the Always Free tier are in the [main](https://github.com/egorshulga/oci-always-free-k8s/tree/main) branch, scripts for Pay-as-You-Go are in the [free-pay-as-you-go](https://github.com/egorshulga/oci-always-free-k8s/tree/free-pay-as-you-go) branch. Options differences are described [here](https://github.com/egorshulga/oci-always-free-k8s#network-considerations-for-always-free-tier).

## Getting started

1. Sign up to Oracle Cloud [here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/). 

Choose home region carefully, as it can't be changed in the future, and Always Free tier tenants can't use other regions to provision resources. Prefer regions with multiple availability domains. Check out the list [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm#:~:text=the%20following%20table%20lists%20the%20regions%20in%20the%20oracle%20cloud%20infrastructure%20commercial%20realm).

2. Download [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) and make it available in path. Check terraform is installed with `terraform -v`.

3. Create Oracle API signing key pair. To do this, login to your Oracle Cloud account, and go to _User Settings_ -> _API Keys_. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6253488/149008215-f176865e-42b7-4d4a-9df9-c29e6339d72e.png)

Then select _Generate API Key Pair_. Download both public and private keys and put it to `.oci` folder in your home dir (e.g. `~/.oci` or `%USERPROFILE%\.oci`). Click _Add_.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6253488/149004376-8c99fdb6-ad1e-463c-a6ac-0baed829a523.png)

Note configuration keys from the displayed snippet. It will be used to configure Terraform `oci` provider.  

To access the configuration snippet later, press 3 dots button next to key's fingerprint -> _View Configuration file_.

4. Prepare ssh keypair.

To generate one, go to `.ssh` folder in your home dir (`mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cd ~/.ssh` or `mkdir %USERPROFILE%\.ssh & cd %USERPROFILE%\.ssh`), and then call `ssh-keygen`.

On Windows it's easier to switch to WSL (run `bash` in `.ssh` dir) to generate the key pair.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -b 2048 -C ssh-key -f id_ed25519
```

## Cluster setup

1. Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/egorshulga/oci-always-free-k8s && cd oci-always-free-k8s
```

2. Copy the file `variables.auto.tfvars.example` into `variables.auto.tfvars`. Set correct values for all of the variables (please note backslash in paths should be escaped: `\ -> \\`).

3. Run Terraform.

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform displays a list of changes it is going to apply to resources. Check it carefully, and then answer `yes`.

Terraform has made some changes to the provider dependency selections recorded
in the .terraform.lock.hcl file. Review those changes and commit them to your
version control system if they represent changes you intended to make.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

> terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform will perform the following actions:

(... lots of resources ...)

Plan: 41 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + cluster_public_ip = (known after apply)

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: 
```
</details>

## Verify cluster

1. Open output value of `cluster_public_ip` in browser. Nginx should show page 404.

2. If you've set up a public dns name, go to `http://{cluster_public_address}/dashboard`. It should redirect to https and open a k8s dashboard login page. Https connection should be established successfully, browser should show a secure lock icon in address bar, meaning that a certificate is correctly issued by LetsEncrypt.

3. Run `kubectl cluster-info && kubectl get nodes`

<details> <summary>Example output</summary>

  ```
  Kubernetes control plane is running at https://cluster.example.com:6443
  CoreDNS is running at https://cluster.example.com:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

  To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
  NAME       STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION

4. SSH to the leader instance

<details> <summary>Example output</summary>

```
> ssh ubuntu@{cluster-public-ip}
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.11.0-1022-oracle aarch64)
This is a leader instance, which was provisioned by Terraform
ubuntu@leader:~$
```
</details>

5. SSH to worker instances. This can be achieved by connecting to workers via leader instance, which acts as a bastion.

<details> <summary>Example output</summary>

```
> ssh -J ubuntu@{cluster-public-ip} ubuntu@worker-0.private.vcn.oraclevcn.com
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.11.0-1022-oracle aarch64)
This is a worker instance, which was provisioned by Terraform
ubuntu@worker-0:~$
```
</details>

## Consumed Oracle Cloud resources

Below you can see a list of Oracle Cloud resources, that are provisioned as a result of applying the scripts. Limits are provided for reference, they are up to date as of January 14, 2022.

Please note that if you already have some resources in your tenancy, then the scripts may fail due to limits imposed by Oracle. You may need to change some resources values (e.g. change count of provisioned workers in [main.tf](main.tf)).

The script provisions a K8s cluster on the leader and worker VMs. Below you can see a list of resources that are available in the K8s cluster once it is provisioned.

    <td>Available on https://{cluster-ip}/dashboard/ or https://{cluster-dns-name}/dashboard/ (the latter uses a LetsEncrypt certificate)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Cluster connectivity

As all of the compute instances are connected to a private subnet, it required a NAT gateway for outbound internet connections. There are no egress security rules imposed (outgoing connections are allowed to go to `0.0.0.0/0`).

Ingress connectivity is achieved via Network Load Balancer, which is available from the internet via public IP. Below there is a list of open ports. There are no security rules to limit source IPs (incoming connections are allowed to originate from `0.0.0.0/0`).

## Troubleshooting

### Out of host capacity

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6253488/149601001-cda85054-d43d-4c50-a373-14e1e5343197.png)

This error means that Oracle has run out of free ARM compute resources in selected region.

Possible workaround could be to switch to another availability domain for provisioning compute resources (see [main.tf](main.tf)), or to retry cluster provisioning in some days (as Oracle promises to deploy new capacity over time).
